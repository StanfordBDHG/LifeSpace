*DESCRIPTION:*
You are invited to participate in a research study on life space, or the space within which people live, work, and recreate. Based on a custom iPhone Life Space application, we will develop individual life space maps (geographic footprint) in order to evaluate the association of aspects of environmental features with health and well-being. This research study is looking for 120 StrokeCog participants to be enrolled. Stanford University expects to enroll 120 research study participants.

To participate in this study, you will download the LifeSpace App and complete the consent form. As a part of this research study, you will be asked to sign in using your AppleID. To do this, you will have to review and agree to the LifeSpace App Privacy Policy. This document is separate from this consent form.

The LifeSpace App will passively capture your location for two weeks. Each evening, you will complete a brief survey of four questions on the app.  

*RISKS AND BENEFITS:*
The primary risk associated with this study is a potential loss of privacy, and we have taken all measures to minimize this risk. If for any reason you do not wish to have your location recorded temporarily, you can toggle the “Track My Location” button and the app will stop recording until you start it again. Your data are stored securely, and your name and Apple ID will be removed from your data when it is downloaded. 
We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study. The long-term goal of this research is to better understand the role of the physical environment in contributing to cognitive trajectory after stroke.
Your decision whether or not to participate in this study will not affect your medical care.

*TIME INVOLVEMENT:* 
Our LifeSpace App will passively capture location for a period of two weeks. Each evening, you will be asked to complete a brief survey of three questions (1-2 minutes). 

*PAYMENTS:*
You will not receive payment for your participation.
