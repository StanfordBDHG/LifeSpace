# LifeSpace

This repository contains the LifeSpace mobile application, developed for the [Odden Research Lab](https://michelleodden.com) in the Department of Epidemiology and Population Health at the Stanford School of Medicine.

To evaluate how environmental conditions influence health, we have developed a novel measure of the space within which individuals live and move. By mapping the space within which individuals live and move, we can study features of the social and built environment that support health, and identify opportunities for intervention to protect disadvantaged communities.

LifeSpace was built using the [Spezi](https://github.com/StanfordSpezi/Spezi) framework and digital health ecosystem developed by [Stanford Biodesign Digital Health](https://bdh.stanford.edu/).

## Features

- Onboarding and consent process via [SpeziOnboarding](https://github.com/StanfordSpezi/SpeziOnboarding).
- Passive location data collection via [Core Location](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation).
- Interactive maps via [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
- Passive health data collection via [SpeziHealthKit](https://github.com/stanfordspezi/spezihealthkit) including activity and gait metrics.
- Daily surveys via [ResearchKit](https://www.apple.com/lae/researchkit/).

## Development

See [SETUP.md] for information on how to set the application up for development.
